# CarSkin2DAE
Exports GBX skins of TM2 to COLLADA (.dae) model files.
# How to use
Drag a GBX skin on the executable or start it in the command line, e.g. `CarSkin2DAE.exe MainBody.solid.gbx`.
A resulting .dae COLLADA 3d model file will be placed right next to the GBX file, ready to be imported in Blender and for many other use cases.
The original skin part names are kept intact.
